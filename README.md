Odin Project Rock-Paper-Scissors

From the Odin project's <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/dom-manipulation">curriculum</a>.

The goal of the project was to create a webpage which takes user input and simulates rounds of Rock-Paper-scissors using a browser GUI.
